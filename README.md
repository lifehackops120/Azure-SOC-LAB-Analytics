The Importance of Applying NIST CSF and NIST 800-53
Applying NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) and NIST 800-53 is crucial for keeping our digital world safe. NIST CSF helps us understand how to protect our computers and data from bad guys, while NIST 800-53 provides specific steps and rules to follow. Together, they create a strong defense against cyber threats.

In our Azure lab, we started with an environment that was not secure. This means it was easy for hackers to break in and cause trouble. To fix this, we used tools like Azure Log Analytics and Microsoft Sentinel.

Azure Log Analytics is like a detective for our computers. It helps us look at logs (records of what happens on our computers) and find anything strange. We used KQL queries (a special language for searching logs) to find security issues. For example, we looked for unusual login attempts or changes to important files.

Microsoft Sentinel is like a superhero for our security. It watches over our computers all the time and alerts us if something bad happens. It also helps us respond quickly to stop attacks. By using Sentinel, we could set up rules to automatically catch and fix problems.

Before we applied NIST CSF and NIST 800-53, our lab was like a house with open doors and windows. After applying these frameworks, we locked all the doors and windows and set up an alarm system. This makes it much harder for hackers to get in and keeps our data safe.

In summary, using NIST CSF and NIST 800-53 in Azure, along with tools like Log Analytics and Sentinel, helps protect our digital world from cyber threats.
